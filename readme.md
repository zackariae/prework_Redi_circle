# 🍽️ ReDI Restaurant - Code Challenge  

Our restaurant is launching tomorrow, but we haven't been able to finish our website! Can you help us?  

We've made some improvements, including:  
- ✅ **Search functionality**: Users can search for dishes using the input field.  
- ✅ **Favorites feature**: Users can add or remove dishes from their favorites and view them in a dedicated section.
