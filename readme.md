# Code Challenge
[]Search Functionality_
[]Wishlist_

## What we're looking for
Our resturaunt is launching tomorrow, but we haven't been able to finish our website! Can you help us?

We really need to get our search functionality finished, we've got an input field ready, but we need to complete the search functionality. Given an input string, it should return matching dishes.

As a bonus, we'd really like to have a wishlist feature, where users can add (and remove) dishes. They should be able to view this list somewhere.

## What we want to see

- We're more interested in your thought process, rather than finished production code.
- If you need a reminder on a certain syntax, it's fine to ask the screener, or use your preferreed search engine for a reminder.
- It's good to ask questions! If there's anything at all you're not sure about, your screener will be happy to help.
